## Introduction
This project serves as a beginner-friendly guide to understanding and implementing basic arithmetic operations and mathematical functions in JavaScript. It covers topics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and more.

## Arithmetic Operations
The script showcases examples of common arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder). Additionally, it explores additional functions like exponentiation, square root, and absolute value.

## Additional Functions
The code demonstrates the use of various additional functions provided by the JavaScript Math object, such as generating random numbers, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), and logarithmic functions (natural logarithm and base 10 logarithm).

## User Interaction
The script includes examples of user interaction through alert boxes, prompt boxes (for user input), and confirm boxes. Users can interact with the script by providing input through prompts and confirming actions.

## Looping Examples
Explore different types of loops in JavaScript, including while loops, for loops, for-each loops (for arrays), for-in loops (for objects), and do-while loops. Each loop type is illustrated with simple examples.

## Conditional Statements
Understand conditional statements such as switch-case and if-else statements. The code provides examples of conditional branching based on certain conditions.

## Functions
Learn about defining and using functions in JavaScript. The script includes examples of static functions, dynamic functions (using function expressions), functions with automatic return, and functions with default parameters.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nayanatara07/Basic-Arithmetic-Operations.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Explore the examples and experiment with the code.

Feel free to modify and expand upon the code as you explore JavaScript programming concepts.

Happy coding!
